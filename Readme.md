# LambdaSchool Assessment

## Instructions
---
Follow the instructions in `script.js`.  The problems become progressively more difficulut and you are not expected to be able to answer all of them.  Don't worry if there are concepts you don't understand or if you are unable to finish the assessment.  Our purpose is to get a basic idea of roughly how much preparation you would need before starting one of our classes.
